A small project built as part of the interview process at Foster Moore.

To build this application I used NextJs to build a full stack type safe application using TypeScript prisma, graphql, and mongoDB.

I used Genql to generate a typed graphql client and then used Apollo-micro-server to make it available.

File upload was originally a simple system that uploaded locally but after realising that I would not be able to do this on Vercel I swapped to using cloudinary.
